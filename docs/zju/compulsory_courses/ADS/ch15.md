k-way merge：将 k 个有序序列合并为 1 个有序序列。这里的有序序列被称为 run，而将 $k·c$ 个 run 合并成 $c$ 个 run 的过程，称为 1 个 pass

Pass 1：2-way merge，将 $T_1$ 的 5 段数据均分到两条 tape 上

$number\ of\ passes\ = 1 + \lceil \log_k \dfrac{N}{M} \rceil$

使用 k-way merge 至少需要 2k 个 tape

???+ question "PTA 15.4"

    Given 100,000,000 records of 256 bytes each, and the size of the internal memory is 128MB.  If simple 2-way merges are used, how many passes do we have to do?

    A. 10<br/>
    B. 9<br/>
    C. 8<br/>
    D. 7

        $M = 2^{27} B, N = 10^{8} \times 2^8$

        $pass = 1 + \lceil \log_2 \dfrac{10^8 \times 2^8}{2^{27}} \rceil = 9$

## 减少 pass 的数量

增加 k 可以减少 pass 的数量

采用 Replacement Selection

???+ question "PTA 15.2"

    In external sorting, a k-way merging is usually used in order to reduce the number of passes and we will take the k as large as possible as long as we have enough amount of tapes.

???+ question "PTA 15.6"

    In external sorting, in order to reduce the number of passes, minimizing the initial number of runs (i.e. generating longer runs ) is a good idea. Suppose the input record keys are (25, 74, 56, 34, 21, 11, 29, 80, 38, 53) and the internal memery can hold only 3 records, the minimum number of initial runs obtained by replacement selection is__ 。

    A. 1<br/>
    B. 2<br/>
    C. 3<br/>
    D. 4

        run1: 25 34 56 74

        run2: 11 21 29 38 53 80

???+ question "PTA 15.8"

    Suppose that the replacement selection is applied to generate longer runs with a priority queue of size 4. Given the sequence of numbers { 9, 75, 17, 12, 88, 91, 25, 22, 35, 41, 58, 96, 15 }.  Which of the following gives the second output run?

    A. 22 35 88 91<br/>
    B. 22 35 41 58 88 91 96<br/>
    C. 22 35 41 58 96<br/>
    D. 22 35 41 58

        run1: 9 12 17 25 75 88 91

        run2: 22 35 41 58 96

        run3: 15

## 减少 tape 的数量

如果 run 的数量是某个斐波那契数 $F_N$，那么最好的方法就是分成 $F_{N-1}$ 和 $F_{N-2}$ 两个 runs

对于 k-way merge，$F_N^k = F_{N-1}^k + \cdots F_{N-k}^k,\ F_N^k = 0(0\leqslant N \leqslant k-2),\ F_{k-1}^k = 1$

只需要 k + 1 个 tapes

假设 $T_1$ 有 34 个 runs 需要 merge，若采用 2-way merge，首先将其拆分成 21 和 13 两段

| $T_1$ | $T_2$ | $T_3$ | 说明 |
| :--: | :--: | :--: | :-- |
| 21 | 13 | - | |
| 8 | - | 13 | $T_1$ 的前 13 个 run 与 $T_2$ 合并，写入 $T_3$ |
| - | 8 | 5 | $T_3$ 的前 8 个 run 与 $T_1$ 合并，写入 $T_2$ |
| 5 | 3 | - | |
| 2 | - | 3 | |
| - | 2 | 1 | |
| 1 | 1 | - | |
| - | - | 1 | |

???+ question "PTA 15.1"

    To merge 55 runs using 3 tapes for a 2-way merge, the original distribution (34, 21) is better than (27, 28).

???+ question "PTA 15.5"

    In external sorting, suppose we have 5 runs of lengths 2, 8, 9, 5, and 3, respectively.  Which of the following merging orders can obtain the minimum merge time?

    A. merge runs of lengths 2 and 3 to obtain Run#1; merge Run#1 with the one of length 5 to obtain Run#2; merge Run#2 with the one of length 8 to obtain Run#3; merge Run#3 with the one of length 9<br/>
    B. merge runs of lengths 2 and 3 to obtain Run#1; merge Run#1 with the one of length 5 to obtain Run#2; merge runs of lengths 8 and 9 to obtain Run#3; merge Run#2 and Run#3<br/>
    C. merge runs of lengths 2 and 3 to obtain Run#1; merge runs of lengths 5 and 8 to obtain Run#2; merge Run#1 and Run#2 to obtain Run#3; merge Run#3 with the one of length 9<br/>
    D. merge runs of lengths 2 and 3 to obtain Run#1; merge runs of lengths 5 and 8 to obtain Run#2; merge Run#2 with the one of length 9 to obtain Run#3; merge Run#1 and Run#3

## 并行

通常对于 k-way merge，我们需要 2k 个 input buffers 和 2 个 output buffer

    Suppose we have the internal memory that can handle 12 numbers at a time, and the following two runs on the tapes:

    Run 1: 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12
    
    Run 2: 2, 4, 6, 15, 20, 25, 30, 32
    
    Use 2-way merge with 4 input buffers and 2 output buffers for parallel operations.  Which of the following three operations are NOT done in parallel?

    A. 1 and 2 are written onto the third tape; 3 and 4 are merged into an output buffer; 6 and 15 are read into an input buffer<br/>
    B. 3 and 4 are written onto the third tape; 5 and 6 are merged into an output buffer; 8 and 9 are read into an input buffer<br/>
    C. 5 and 6 are written onto the third tape; 7 and 8 are merged into an output buffer; 20 and 25 are read into an input buffer<br/>
