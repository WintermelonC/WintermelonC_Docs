# Python

!!! quote "The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters"

    Beautiful is better than ugly.<br/>
    Explicit is better than implicit.<br/>
    Simple is better than complex.<br/>
    Complex is better than complicated.<br/>
    Flat is better than nested.<br/>
    Sparse is better than dense.<br/>
    Readability counts.<br/>
    Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.<br/>
    Although practicality beats purity.<br/>
    Errors should never pass silently.<br/>
    Unless explicitly silenced.<br/>
    In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.<br/>
    There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.<br/>
    Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.<br/>
    Now is better than never.<br/>
    Although never is often better than \*right\* now.<br/>
    If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.<br/>
    If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.<br/>
    Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!<br/>
